I write silly little projects for fun. I try not to take myself too seriously, but I thoroughly enjoy spending time making my work the best it can be.

I'm proud to call myself part of [the Noxcrew](https://noxcrew.com), where I build tools for our Bedrock Marketplace team. I also occasionally work on the [MCC Island](https://mcchampionship.com) moderation system.
